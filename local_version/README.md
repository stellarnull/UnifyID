### Local Version

Since I only have limited quota bits, I cannot manage to generate the wave task bacause the bits exceed the limit. To solve this problem, I create this local version where I get the bits from random.org and save them locally in the .rawbytes files. Everytime I want to use the bits, I choose from the local files and then I can save some quota.
